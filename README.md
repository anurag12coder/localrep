This is adding new files in a new repo<br>
git remote add origin link_from_github after creating new repo with same name as in localhost.<br>
git remote -v to check if the origin is correct<br>
git branch to check the branch<br>
git branch -M main to change the name of the branch to main from master<br>
git push -u origin main here -u makes a shortcut so that from here on you can simply put git push and all new<br>
additions will be made to the same branch<br><br><br>

so the basic workflow of git will be get the repo clone(git clone"get link from github") it ,<br>
 then make changes, add the changes, commit the changes finally push them<br>
